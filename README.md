## Project Description 

Hello and thanks for checking out our project!  

We've built a **maze game web application** that lets players generate and solve mazes with varying difficulty levels. The game is hosted on **PythonAnywhere** and developed using **Python’s Flask** framework for the backend. 
Maze generation and solving algorithms are implemented in Python and made available via API calls, while the frontend is built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** for a smooth user experience.  

Our game includes following features:  
- 🏠 A landing page  
- 🧩 Maze generation with adjustable difficulty levels  
- 🔄 Maze-solving assistance for stuck players  
- 🎮 Multi-key support (Arrow keys & WASD)  
- 🚀 More features coming soon!  

We followed the **Scrum methodology**, ensuring an iterative and efficient development process. Laia took on the role of surrogate Product Owner. Nicolas took on the role of Scrum Master.

Feel free to explore the code, contribute, or reach out with any questions! 🎯
