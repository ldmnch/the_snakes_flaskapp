## Explanation and Approach... Welcome to the Maze üêç

**We wanted to do a fun app game and thought about _ssssnakes._**

**We started by mapping out our user journey in broad terms:**
- Landing Page. Some core layout to bind our flask app.
- Play. Some function to generate the game (maze).
- Solve. Some function to solve the game (for lousy players).

**Based on these 3 ideas, we essentially divided our sprints:**

- First sprint. Can we generate a playable maze?
- Second sprint. How can we best execute the two core algorithms?
- Third sprint. What features make the game appealing? Do they work?

### Core Structure: Disjoint Set Union (DSU)

**What it is:** A data structure that tracks non-overlapping (disjoint) sets of elements (our maze cells).

**Essential Operations for Us:**
1.  `find(item)`: Determines which set an `item` (cell) belongs to.
- Answers: "Are these two cells already connected in the maze?"
2.  `union(item1, item2)`: Merges the sets containing `item1` and `item2`.
- Action: "These two cells (and their groups) are now connected."

**Key Optimizations (for speed):**
- **Path Compression:** Flattens the structure during `find` operations.
- **Union by Rank/Size:** Keeps the set "trees" balanced during `union`.
- Result: Makes `find` and `union` almost constant time on average: `O(Œ±(V_cells))` where `V_cells = D¬≤` (number of cells), and Œ± is the very slow-growing inverse Ackermann function.

**Why DSU?** Enables Kruskal's to efficiently determine if removing a wall (connecting two cells) would form a cycle.

### 1 Maze Generation: Kruskal's Algorithm

**The Goal:** Create a "perfect" maze: all parts reachable, no loops.
Technically: Constructing a random spanning tree on a grid of cells.

**How it Works (with DSU):**
1.  Start: Each cell is its own separate region (DSU initialized with `D¬≤` sets).
2.  List all interior walls (potential edges); **randomly shuffle** this list (crucial for generating diverse mazes).
3.  Process walls one by one:
- If a wall separates cells from *different* regions (DSU `find`):
	- Remove the wall (create a passage).
	- Merge the two regions (DSU `union`).
- If cells are already in the *same* region: Do nothing (this prevents loops).

**Why Kruskal's for Our Maze?**
- Produces well-structured, perfect mazes.
- Random shuffling offers high variety in maze layouts.
- Highly efficient due to nearly constant-time DSU operations for cycle detection.

### 2 Maze Solving: Breadth-First Search 

**The Goal:** Find the *shortest* path (in terms of number of steps) from the player's start to the maze's exit.

**How it Works:**
1.  View the maze as a graph: passage cells are **nodes**, direct paths between adjacent passages are **edges**.
2.  Start at the player's location (node).
3.  Explore outwards in layers using a **queue** (FIFO - First-In, First-Out):
	- Check all immediate neighbors (1 step/edge away).
	- Then, all *new* neighbors from those (2 steps/edges away), and so on.
4.  Keep track of `visited` cells (nodes) to avoid cycles or redundant checks.
5.  The first time BFS reaches the exit node, that path is guaranteed to be the shortest (by number of edges).

**Why BFS for Our Solver?**
- Guarantees the shortest path (in terms of number of steps).
- Always finds a path if one exists.
- Efficient and relatively simple for grid-based pathfinding.

### Complexity Insights

**Algorithm 1: Maze Generation (Kruskal's with DSU)**
Let `V_cells = D¬≤` (number of cells/nodes in the maze).
Let `E_walls ‚âà 2D¬≤` (number of potential interior walls/edges).

**Time:** `O(E_walls log E_walls + E_walls * Œ±(V_cells))`
  - Simplified: `O(D¬≤ log D + D¬≤ * Œ±(D¬≤))`
  - Involves sorting/processing walls and many DSU operations.
  - `Œ±(V_cells)` is nearly constant, making it very fast; scales well.

**Space:** `O(V_cells + E_walls)`
  - Simplified: `O(D¬≤)`
  - For grid, DSU arrays (`parent`, `rank`), and wall list.

**Algorithm 2: Maze Solving (BFS)**
Operates on the graph of `V_cells = D¬≤` passage cells.
(The underlying array representation of the maze is `(2D+1)x(2D+1)`).

**Time:** `O(V_cells + E_passages)` where `E_passages` are connections between passage cells.
  - Simplified: `O(D¬≤)`
  - Visits each passage cell and connection at most once.

**Space:** `O(V_cells)`
  - Simplified: `O(D¬≤)`
  - For the queue & `visited` set, proportional to the number of passage cells.
