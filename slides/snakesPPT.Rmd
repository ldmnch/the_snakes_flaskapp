## Explanation and Approach... Welcome to the Maze 🐍

**We wanted to do a fun app game and thought about _ssssnakes._**

**We started by mapping out our user journey in broad terms:**
- Landing Page. Some core layout to bind our flask app.
- Play. Some function to generate the game (maze).
- Solve. Some function to solve the game (for lousy players).

**Based on these 3 ideas, we essentially divided our sprints:**

- First sprint. Can we generate a playable maze?
- Second sprint. How can we best execute the two core algorithms?
- Third sprint. What features make the game appealing? Do they work?

# Analysis of Algorithmic Complexity

### Core Structure: Disjoint Set Union (DSU)
.center[**(Our "Connectivity Manager")**]

**What it is:** A data structure that tracks non-overlapping (disjoint) sets.

**Essential Operations for Us:**
1.  `find(item)`: Determines which set an `item` (cell) belongs to.
- Answers: "Are these two cells already connected?"
2.  `union(item1, item2)`: Merges the sets containing `item1` and `item2`.
- Action: "These two cells (and their groups) are now connected."

**Key Optimizations (for speed):**
- **Path Compression:** Flattens the structure during `find` operations.
- **Union by Rank/Size:** Keeps the set "trees" balanced during `union`.
- Result: Makes `find` and `union` almost constant time on average: `O(α(N))` (α is extremely slow-growing).

**Why DSU?** Kruskal's algorithm efficiently checks for/prevents redundancy.

### 1 Maze Generation: Kruskal's Algorithm
.center[*(Building the Maze, Path by Path)*]

**The Goal:** Create a "perfect" maze: all parts reachable, no loops.
Technically: Constructing a random spanning tree on a grid of cells.

**How it Works (with DSU):**
1.  Start: Each cell is its own separate region (DSU initialized).
2.  List all interior walls; shuffle this list randomly.
3.  Process walls one by one:
- If a wall separates cells from *different* regions (checked via DSU `find`):
	- Remove the wall (create a passage).
	- Merge the two regions (using DSU `union`).
- If cells are already in the *same* region: Do nothing (this prevents loops).

**Why Kruskal's for Our Maze?**
- Produces well-structured, perfect mazes.
- Random shuffling offers high variety in maze layouts.
- DSU makes it very efficient.

### 2 Maze Solving: Breadth-First Search 
.center[*(Finding the Quickest Way Out)*]

**The Goal:** Find the *shortest* path from the player's start to the maze's exit.

**How it Works:**
1.  Think of the maze as a map (graph: cells are locations, passages are roads).
2.  Start at the player's location.
3.  Explore outwards in layers using a **queue** (FIFO - First-In, First-Out):
	- Check all immediate neighbors (1 step away).
	- Then, all *new* neighbors from those (2 steps away), and so on.
4.  Keep track of `visited` cells to avoid going in circles or re-checking.
5.  The first time BFS reaches the exit, that path is guaranteed to be the shortest.

**Why BFS for Our Solver?**
- Guarantees the shortest path (in terms of number of steps).
- Always finds a path if one exists.
- Efficient and relatively simple for grid-based paths.

### Complexity Insights
**Algorithm 1 (for `D x D` cells):** Let `V = D²` (number of cells).

**Time:** `O(V * α(V))` or `O(D² * α(D²))`.
- Very fast. Nearly linear in the number of cells, scales well for big mazes.

**Space:** `O(V)` or `O(D²)`.
- Needs memory proportional to the number of cells for the grid and DSU.

**Algorithm 2 (grid with `N` cells):** Let `N` be total cells in grid -> `(2D+1)²`.

**Time:** `O(N)`.
- Fast. Visits each cell and passage at most once.

**Space:** `O(N)`.
- Needs memory for queue & visited set, potentially up to the maze size.
